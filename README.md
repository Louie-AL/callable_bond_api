# Callable Bond API

This project is a Flask-based API for simulating financial instruments and pricing callable and convertible bonds using Monte Carlo methods. It is designed to support integration with front-end interfaces or other systems that require access to advanced bond pricing computations.

## Features

- Health check endpoint
- Monte Carlo simulation of stock prices
- Callable bond valuation
- Convertible bond valuation
- Modular and extensible code structure

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Louie-AL/callable_bond_api.git
cd callable_bond_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the API

```bash
python run.py
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

**GET /**  
Returns a simple message confirming the API is live.

```json
{ "message": "Callable Bond Pricing API is running!" }
```

---

### Simulate Stock Price

**POST /simulate-stock**

Simulates stock price paths using geometric Brownian motion.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "n_simulations": 1000,
  "n_steps": 252,
  "initial_price": 100,
  "mu": 0.07,
  "sigma": 0.2,
  "time_interval": 1
}
```

**Response:**

A JSON object containing simulated price paths.

### [Planned] Price Callable Bond

**POST /price-callable-bond**

(Coming Soon) Prices a callable bond based on simulated interest rates and call schedule.

---

### [Planned] Price Convertible Bond

**POST /price-convertible-bond**

(Coming Soon) Prices a convertible bond using stock simulation and bond cash flows.
